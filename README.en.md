# pr-stats

üåè [**ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥**](README.md) | English

GitHub Actions to generate useful statistics for pull requests.

It calculates metrics such as the average time to merge per PR and reviewer response times. The statistics can be [customized](#Customize) as needed.

For ways to apply it in your tasks, see the [usage examples](#Usage-examples).

## Usage

Create the following file in your GitHub repository:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pr-stats.yml
name: PR Stats
on:
  workflow_dispatch: # Specify the event that triggers the action
  # https://docs.github.com/ko/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows
jobs:
  pr-stats:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: PR Stats
        uses: "naver/pr-stats@v1.0.0" # Path to the action and the version to use
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          # Be sure to check the documentation for 'with'.
```

**Usage example) Generate results as a PR**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pr-stats.yml
    # ...
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: PR Stats
        uses: "naver/pr-stats@v1.0.0"
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v5
```

With this setup, a PR will be created with `pr.csv`, `prList.csv`, and `user.csv` files under the `./stats/` directory.

## Customize

By adding a `stats.config.js` file to the root of your repository, you can modify the statistics to be output.

> The `stats.config.js` file is optional. If it's not created, the default behavior will be used.


### Controlling statistics fields

For example, if you configure it like this, `pr` will output `number`, `title`, and `fileCount` fields, `prList` will not be output, and `user` will only output the `id`.

```javascript
// {targetRepo}/stats.config.js
module.exports = {
    pr: ["number", "title", "fileCount"],
    prList: [],
    user: ["id"],
};
```

### Adding statistics fields

The default statistics configuration (`defaultStats`) is passed as an argument to the exported function. This allows you to maintain the default statistics settings while adding specific statistics.

Here's an example of calculating the fastest response time(ms).

```javascript
// {targetRepo}/stats.config.js
const firstResponseTime = pr => {
    const {timeline} = pr;
    const firstResponse = timeline.comments.find(comment => timeline.firstRequestedAt < comment.createdAt);
    const value = Number(firstResponse.createdAt) - Number(timeline.firstRequestedAt);

    return {value, message: `First Response Time: ${value}`};
};

module.exports = defaultStats => {
    return {
        ...defaultStats,
        pr: [...defaultStats.pr, ["firstResponseTime", firstResponseTime]],
    };
};
```

## Usage examples
Using this action, you can clearly understand your team's code review status and identify areas for improvement.

### 1. Analysis through a correlation table

For example, using Python code or generative AI, you can create a correlation table like the one below based on PR statistics.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42774705-ae06-4bed-aff9-17e4c82034a1" width="600" height="600" alt="correlation-heatmap">

If you want to shorten the time it takes to merge, you could find metrics with a high correlation to `timeFromReviewToMerge` and focus on improving them.

### 2. Analysis through scatter plots

You can assess how much progress has been made by analyzing numerical changes.

For example, to see how much the review response time and participation rate of team members have improved, you can use scatter plots and density charts like the ones below.

<img width="700" alt="before" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b6be920-45ae-4483-95fb-711fdc24c10f">

In the scatter plot on the left, each point represents the average response time and participation rate of a reviewer. Points closer to the top-left indicate higher participation and shorter response times.

If the chart looks like the one below after improvement activities, it shows that the efforts were highly successful.
